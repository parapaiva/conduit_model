# Selenium Automation test 

This was a sample test automation project using the Page Object Model patter to model the [Conduit](https://realworld.svelte.dev/) website.

I created a model for the Home Page model that returns an Article Page when the `access_article` is used.

The example test case `test_get_article_text.py` shows a test script that accesses the first article, and retrieves its texts to assert its initial content.

The idea of this project is to show Page Object principles and implementation.
